### Product increment
- Summary: The Product Increment is the sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint the new Product Increment must be in a usable condition and meet the Scrum Team's Definition of Done.
- In Scrum, the Development Team delivers each Sprint a Product Increment. 
The increment must consist of thoroughly tested code that has been built into an executable, and the user operation of the functionality is documented either in Help files or user documentation. These requirements are documented in the Definition of Done. 
If everything works fine and the Development Team has estimated well, the Product Increment includes all items, which were planned in the Sprint Backlog, tested and documented.
